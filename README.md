Unsupervised-Machine-Learning
-------

In this example of unsupervised machine learning, I use Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes. I used a variety of tools including StandardScaler, K-means Modelling, Clustering with Principal Component Analysis, and hvPlot.
